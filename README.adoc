= Istio Circuit Breaker mission

== Purpose
Showcase Istio's Circuit Breaker via a (minimally) instrumented Spring Boot application

== Prerequisites
. Openshift 3.10 cluster
. Istio 1.0.x installed on the aforementioned cluster using the link:https://github.com/Maistra/istio-operator[Istio Operator].
.. Follow link:https://github.com/Maistra/openshift-ansible/blob/maistra-0.1.0-ocp-3.1.0-istio-1.0.0/istio/Installation.md[these] instructions for more information about the Operator
. Login to the cluster with the *admin* user

== Environment preparation

Create a new project/namespace on the cluster. This is where your application will be deployed.

```bash
oc new-project <whatever valid project name you want>
```

In link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/servicemesh-install/servicemesh-install.html#configuring-security-constraints-for-application-service-accounts[OpenShift] each service account must be granted permissions with the anyuid and privileged Security Context Constraints (SCC) to enable the sidecars to run correctly.

```bash
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default -n <whatever valid project name you want>
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n <whatever valid project name you want>
```

== Build and deploy the application

=== With Fabric8 Maven Plugin (FMP)
Execute the following command to build the project and deploy it to OpenShift:
```bash
mvn clean fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
```
Configuration for FMP may be found both in pom.xml and `src/main/fabric8` files/folders.

=== With Source to Image build (S2I)
Run the following commands to apply and execute the OpenShift templates that will configure and deploy the applications:
```bash
find . | grep openshiftio | grep application | xargs -n 1 oc apply -f

oc new-app --template=spring-boot-istio-circuit-breaker-greeting -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/snowdrop/istio-circuit-breaker-example  -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF=master -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_DIR=greeting-service
oc new-app --template=spring-boot-istio-circuit-breaker-name -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/snowdrop/istio-circuit-breaker-example  -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF=master -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_DIR=name-service
```

= Use Cases

== Access the application

. Run the following command to determine the appropriate URL to access our demo. Make sure you access the URL with the HTTP scheme. HTTPS is NOT enabled by default:
+
```bash
echo "http://$(oc get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}' -n istio-system)/breaker/greeting"
```
+
You should see an error 404 page, since the routing required to expose the application hasn't been performed.
+
. Create a `Gateway` and associated `VirtualService` to direct traffic to the `greeting` and `name` services:
+
```bash
oc create -f istio/gateway.yml
```
+
Refresh the page. You should now see the example application.

== Verify application behavior

. Click on the "Start" button to issue 10 concurrent requests to the `name` service.
. Click on the "Stop" button to stop the requests
. You can change the number of concurrent requests between 1 and 20.
. All calls go through as expected.


=== Initial Circuit Breaker configuration
. Now apply the initial `DestinationRule` that activates Istio's Circuit Breaker on the `name` service, configuring it to allow a maximum of 100 concurrent connections.
+
```bash
oc create -f istio/initial_destination_rule.yml -n $(oc project -q)
```
. You can check that the `DestinationRule` is properly applied by executing:
+
```bash
oc get destinationrules.networking.istio.io
```
. Try the application again.
+
Since we only make up to 20 concurrent connections, the circuit breaker should not trip.

=== Restrictive Circuit Breaker configuration
. Now apply a more restrictive `DestinationRule`, after having remove the initial one:
+
```bash
oc delete -f istio/initial_destination_rule.yml
oc create -f istio/restrictive_destination_rule.yml
```
. Try the application again
+
Since the Circuit Breaker is now configured to only allow one concurrent connection and by default we are sending 10 to the `name` service, we should now see the Circuit Breaker tripping open. However, experimentally, we observe that this does not happen in a clear-cut fashion: the circuit is not always open. In fact, depending on how fast the server on which the application is running, the circuit might not break open at all. The reason for this is that is the `name` service doesn't do much and thus responds quite fast. This, in turn, leads to not having much concurrency at all.

=== Optional: fault injection

We could try to increase contention on the name service using Istio's fault injection behavior by applying a 1-second delay to 50% of the calls to the `name` service.

. Create a new `VirtualService` for the `name` service to inject a processing delay:
+
```bash
oc create -f istio/name_with_delay.yml
```
. Try the application again
+
You should observe that this doesn't seem to change how often the circuit breaks open. This is
due to the fact that the injected delay actually occurs between the services. So, in essence, this only time shifts the requests, only increasing concurrency marginally (due to the fact that only 50% of the requests are delayed). This still doesn't let us observe the circuit breaking open properly.

. For more comfort, let's return to the original configuration by deleting the `VirtualService` we just introduced:
```bash
oc delete -f istio/name_with_delay.yml
```

=== Simulate load on the name service

* We need to increase contention on the `name` service in order to have enough concurrent connections to trip open the circuit breaker. We can accomplish this by simulating load on the `name` service by asking it to introduce a random processing time. To accomplish this:

. Stop the requests (if that wasn't already the case)
. Checking the "Simulate load" checkbox
. Start the requests.
+
You should now observe the circuit breaking open by observing lots of `Hello, Fallback!` messages.

== Undeploy the application

=== With Fabric8 Maven Plugin (FMP)
```bash
mvn fabric8:undeploy
```

=== With Source to Image build (S2I)
```bash
oc delete all --all
find . | grep openshiftio | grep application | xargs -n 1 oc delete -f
```

=== Remove the namespace
This will delete the project from the OpenShift cluster
```bash
oc delete project <your project name>
```

== Integration tests

To run integration tests, create a new namespace and run maven job
```bash
oc new-project <project-name>
mvn clean verify -Popenshift,openshift-it
```
